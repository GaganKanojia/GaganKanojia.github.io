I am a Ph.D. Student in the Electrical Engineering discipline at [Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar](https://www.iitgn.ac.in/) since May 2015. I am working under the supervision of [Prof. Shanmuganathan Raman](http://people.iitgn.ac.in/~shanmuga/index.html). My research interest lies in Computer Vision, Deep Learning and Computational  Photography. My Ph.D. thesis work is closely related to object motion and multi-view images.
