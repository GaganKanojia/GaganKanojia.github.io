<h3> About Me</h3> 
<small> I am currently working as Technical Lead in Computer Vision at [The Hi-tech Robotic Systemz Ltd.](https://thrsl.ai/). Here, I am working on computer vision related problems which involves monocular videos and 3D point clouds. Prior to this, I was working with [Ola Electric Mobility Pvt. Ltd](https://olaelectric.com/) as Research Engineer II. At OLA Electric, I mainly worked on computer vision related problems which require computationally efficient solutions using monocular videos and images.<br /> 
I completed my doctoral dissertation in the Electrical Engineering discipline at [Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar](https://www.iitgn.ac.in/) under the supervision of [Prof. Shanmuganathan Raman](http://people.iitgn.ac.in/~shanmuga/index.html). My research interests lie in Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Image Processing. During my Ph.D., I worked on problems which involve moving objects present in videos or images captured from different view-points. <br /> 
I am actively working with deep neural networks for images, videos, and image sequences. I have worked on a variety of computer vision related problems like action recognition, dynamic object detection, image sequencing, and image segmentation. I also like to explore the advantages of using multiple images of a scene over a single image in different scenarios.
