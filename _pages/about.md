<h3> About Me</h3> 
<small> I am currently working as Senior Chief Engineer at [Samsung Research Institute-Delhi](https://research.samsung.com/sri-d). Here, I am working on perception and navigation related problems in the field of robotics. Prior to this, I have experience of working with [Novus Hi-tech Robotic Systemz Ltd.](https://novushitech.com/) as Technical Lead in robotics perception and [Ola Electric Mobility Pvt. Ltd](https://olaelectric.com/) as Research Engineer II.<br /> 
I completed my doctoral dissertation in the Electrical Engineering discipline at [Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar](https://www.iitgn.ac.in/) under the supervision of [Prof. Shanmuganathan Raman](http://people.iitgn.ac.in/~shanmuga/index.html). My research interests lie in Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Image Processing. During my Ph.D., I worked on problems which involve moving objects present in videos or images captured from different view-points. <br />
